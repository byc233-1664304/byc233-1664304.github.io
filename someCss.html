		<p>Siamese Cat:<br>
		Both a description and depiction of the Wichienmaat (Siamese cat) first appears in a collection of ancient manuscripts called the Tamra Maew (The Cat-Book Poems) thought to originate from the Ayutthaya Kingdom (1351 to 1767 AD). Over a dozen are now kept in the National Library of Thailand, while others have resurfaced outside of Thailand and are now in the British Library and National Library of Australia. In addition to the old Siamese cat, the Tamra Maew also describes other heritage cats of Thailand including the Korat cat (Malet) which are still bred for preservation in Thailand today and have become popular in other countries, and Konja cat (Black cat), Suphalak (A controversy in Burmese cat).<br>
